This is a web scrapper to download more than one questions of a2oj website as .html file. So to make this code work in your computer .
1.First of all there should be php in your computer. To install php in your computer you can see many guides on google.

2.Now there should also be php-curl in your computer.I installed it in my computer by 
```
sudo apt-get install php7.0-curl
```
3.Now make a folder  named questions where you have downloaded this folder.
4.Now go to terminal and type 
```
php scrappercurl.php
```
PS. This program is not in its best version for now. I have make to much improvements in this code. If anyone one to contribute then your help would be much appreciated.
